# Basic-Notes-PC-App
A very basic Windows Form App that allows you to write a collection of notes that can be saved to and loaded from a file.

The application is made up of two forms, each with a menu strip at the top that holds the options for that window.

The main window allows you to add entries to the listbox, edit a single selected entry that you have previously added, and delete entries from the listbox if you no longer want that entry there. In addition, you can save this list or load another one from this window.

The second window is where you actually write or edit an entry. If you chose to add an entry, it will pop up blank and add whatever you type up to the list after you click save in the menu strip. Should you instead be editting an entry, the program will instead replace that entry with whatever you have typed up.

My Reasons For Creating This App:
*Reinforcing what I learned in college.
*Providing an app that isn't too big for github.
